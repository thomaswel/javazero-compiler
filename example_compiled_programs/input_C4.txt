/* This program is intended to show that compound IF THEN ELSE
    statements and the '>' relop works. The program takes in 
    two integers from the user. If the sum of the two integers
    is 10 or greater, then it multiplies the two input integers
    by 10, recomputes the sum, and prints the new sum. Else (the
    sum is 9 or less) it will multiply the two inputs by 1
    and recompute the sum (which should be the same as the initial
    sum) and will print that sum.*/
