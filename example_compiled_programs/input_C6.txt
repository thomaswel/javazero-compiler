/* This program is meant to demonstrate that
a nested WHILE DO (4 deep) works. It will take
4 input integers from the user that are all less than
10, and then it will enter the nested while loops and 
make all of the inputs equal to 10. It will then print
out all of the input variables, and they should all be
equal to 10.  */
